I am @juanzete, a passionate software developer with experience in JAVA, PHP, Javascript and Python. 
I am a former CEO of MobyDigital, which is a company focused on DX.  
My public repositories are mainly for research, sandbox tests, laboratory and custom forks from open-source projects. 
I am also an IoT and 3D Printing enthusiast,  so probably you will find some of that here.
You can reach me at jtissera@gmail.com ðŸ“«.
